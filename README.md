## A fully open source hyper spectral camera build for Raspberry Pi ## 

### Building the Front Lens ###

Insert the 35mm Lens in to "Part_02 Front Lens" and secure with screw 

Note you will need to edit the source file for part_02 if you use a different lens with greater aperture width 

### Building the Diffraction Grating ###

Using gloves to protect the grating cut a concentric rectangle to the same size as part_06 "diffraction grating" 

Secure with paper tape and avoid covering the transparent plastic of the diffraction grating
